## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store used for caching and messaging.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token for authentication and authorization.
- **AMQP**: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol for message-based communication.
- **Spring AOP**: Aspect-Oriented Programming for cross-cutting concerns.
- **Lombok**: Java library for reducing boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters).
- **Springdoc OpenAPI**: API documentation generation based on OpenAPI standards.
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Provides production-ready features such as health checks and metrics.
- **JUnit5**: Framework for unit testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 (configured via Gradle toolchain).
- PostgreSQL instance running and accessible.
- Redis instance running and accessible.
- Gradle 7.x or higher.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### Build the Project
To build the project using Gradle, run the following command:
```bash
./gradlew build
```
### Configuration
Configure your application.properties (or application.yml) file with necessary settings for database, Redis, and other components. Here's an example for PostgreSQL and Redis configuration:
```properties
# PostgreSQL Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

# Redis Configuration
spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379
```
### Dependencies
This project includes the following key dependencies:

- Core Dependencies: Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Web, PostgreSQL.
- JWT for Authentication: JJWT for handling JSON Web Tokens.
- Validation: Spring Boot validation for input validation.
- Redis: Spring Data Redis for caching and messaging.
- AMQP: Spring Boot Starter AMQP for messaging.
- AOP: Spring Boot Starter AOP for aspect-oriented programming.
- API Documentation: Springdoc OpenAPI for generating Swagger-based API docs.
- Observability: Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring and management.

### Running the Application
To run the application, use the following Gradle command:
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
The application will start on the default port (8080).

### Testing
To run tests, use:
```bash
./gradlew test
```
This will execute unit tests using JUnit 5 and ensure the functionality is working as expected.
